summary: My team utilized AR and QR codes to compete in the 2017 AT&T Hackathon.

 My team decided to play off of the AR theme by making a dynamic gallery that allows the user to network with graphic designers and other digital artists through a gallery where they can showcase their creations in hopes of spreading happiness, or networking with companies that are looking for someone with a particular style. This taught us alot about angles when scanning QR codes, being able to pitch our idea in front of many public figures, and other teams. Although we did not place this was a great learning experience for my four team members and I.
