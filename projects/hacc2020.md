summary: I created a chat bot for the 2020 Hawaii Annual Code Challenge
---
 
HACC 2020 is a local competition hosted by the State of Hawaii and sponsored by many big companies locally/nationally. This competition allows teams to create software solutions for problems that the State of Hawaii provides. This year the theme was "battling covid" where teams were tasked to create solutions such as covid chatbots and covid heat maps. This competition is held annually and is based around the theme of "innovation". 
Here is an attached link to the HACC site: https://hacc.hawaii.gov/

The challenge my team took on was the covid chatbot. We decided to use Google's dialogflow to save us the time of recreating a new chatbot with machine learning intergration. Google's dialogflow helped us draft out the entire dialog experience from the simple introductions to complex data scraping from the State of Hawaii's covid website. Here is a screen shot of the intents we managed to create during the competition's timeframe. ![intents](/images/intents.png) 
Intents allow the flow of conversation to change as the user needs. For example if I wanted to know about current gathering restrictions due to covid, the conversation will take place in the covid.gatherings intent. If the user quickly wants to switch the conversation to buisiness openings then the bot will automatically access the covid.buisiness intent. When talking with the bot during a certain intent, the bot will look for key words in sentences during each rotation of conversation. This is why training the bot is necessary for smooth chatting with the bot. We did this by creating training phrases as seen here ![train](/images/building.png) 
each color coded word signifies a certain value that will be passed into the bot for processing. As you can see all island names are coded in yellow which we created a value for named "$island" Once we have enough information to fully understand what the user needs, the bot can then directly answer their question. For example if the bot had an island name, a key word signifying "count", and a time frame, we know that the user is asking for covid cases over a certain time frame on a certain island. We created dialog for daily cases, weekly cases, monthly cases, and yearly cases.
We used this intent --> training phrase apporach for our entire dialog flow. 

I was on a team with one other person, so this made designating work really easy. I've noticed that bigger teams tend to struggle with delegating tasks fairly. By having two people working on a single project it made communicating and work flow very simple. We shared responsibilities of creating intents and training the bot through training phrases. We both tested the bot and created dialog flow equally. I decided to work with Matthew Kim. I am really happy with my decision to do so because Matt worked very hard and was a good teammate. We would meet three times a week since our schedules didn't line up perfectly. During one meeting of each week we would sit down and brainstorm what to do next. The two following days were delegated to completing the goals we set at the beginning of the week.

While reflecting on my experience I learned that having smaller teams works better for me. I like having constant communication with the entire team. With one other person being the entire team, it makes communication easier. We both split work equally and shared the same vision during the entire project. Things that I would fix for next year would be to have better communication with the competition directors. There was a miscommunication between the project directors and my team which made us fail the technical review. Due to the minor accomplishments and minor setbacks I've learned to stay on top of everything. This includes more than just coding and creating our project, but to stay up to date with directors and moderators of the competiton as well.
