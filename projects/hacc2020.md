summary: I created a chat bot for the 2020 Hawaii Annual Code Challenge
---
 
HACC 2020 is a local competition hosted by the State of Hawaii and sponsored by many big companies locally/nationally. This competition allows teams to create software solutions for problems that the State of Hawaii provides. This year the theme was "battling covid" where teams were tasked to create solutions such as covid chatbots and covid heat maps. This competition is held annually and is based around the theme of "innovation". 
Here is an attached link to the HACC site: https://hacc.hawaii.gov/

The challenge my team took on was the covid chatbot. We decided to use Google's dialogflow to save us the time of recreating a new chatbot with machine learning intergration. Google's dialogflow helped us draft out the entire dialog experience from the simple introductions to complex data scraping from the State of Hawaii's covid website. Here is a screen shot of the intents we managed to create during the competition's timeframe. ![intents](/images/intents.png)
