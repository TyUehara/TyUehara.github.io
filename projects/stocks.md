 The ability to make your own money through analyzation is a very uplifting thing for me. You lose as much as you don't pay attention, but you win through hard work and constant pattern analysis. Financial security has been an interest of mine ever since I realized that your parents can only pay for you for so long. Stocks allows me to work from home, but still grow my portfolio. Although there is no hourly pay, it teaches you skills you will be able to utilize for the rest of my lifetime.
