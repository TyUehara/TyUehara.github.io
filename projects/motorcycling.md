summary: Fixing and riding my motorcycle allows me to relieve stress from school.

  It keeps me thinking about repairs, balance, and on the spot thinking. Riding a motorcycle is a high risk, high reward type of hobby. The faster you go, the more fun you have. The faster you go, the higher chance of you dying... goes up. Riding allows me to put things into perspective as I understand that everytime I get on that bike, it could be my last day on Earth. Having this daily reminder keeps me on my toes, and forces me to sprint for the goals I set.
