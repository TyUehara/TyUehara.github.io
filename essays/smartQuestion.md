After reading Eric Ryamond's guide on how to ask a "smart question", I did some digging on stack overflow to try and find the perfect example. This example of a "good question was titled "Why Does HTML Think "chucknorris" is a color?" I know this may sound like a stupid question, but when you break it down, the person asking the question stated his problem, what language it is, and concise details as to what is his exact problem. The tags that were given are "html" and "background-color". This is great becuase through the tags, we now know that the color is only referring to the background color and not the text or highlight color. Although the answer was very simple "because he is Chuck Norris", his question was answered directly and with ease. 
  An example of a bad question is "How do I pass data through activites on an Android phone?" As you can see, this question is very broad. They did not specify what type of data they are trying to transfer, not what the problem is. It ended up that the person asking the question was actually wondering about log-in data. Being broad about his/her subject that they needed help in resulted in a wide range of questions digging down to hardware interactions, to memory interactions with the different aopplications. Now I know what not to do when I ask a question in Stack Overflow....
