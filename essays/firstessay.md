Growing up in a middle class family, I had the priviledge to experience the benefits that technology has to offer. Playing videogames slowly became a huge part of my life that still exists to this day. Being on or around a computer has always brought me comfort and isloation from stress of school. I entered college as a Marine Biology Major at UH Manoa. After a semester I quickly changed to computer science wanting to learn how computers work, and the capabilities they have to offer. Along with this change in major I had to ask myself "what is the goal of all this?" My answer wasn't immediate, but I settled on the mindset that by learning about something that most people won't want to, will only seperate me from the majority, but also make me valuable.

I'm currently interested in the security aspect of Computer Science because protecting something, or someone that is being exploited makes me feel useful. Although I am no where near amazing at my study, I am eager to keep learning and exanding my toolsets.
