HACC-hui is a website that allows participants of the HACC 2020 to create, manage, and choose their teams. HACC-hui was created using Meteor and was the backbone of how HACC was held this year due to covid. HACC-hui listed teams, competition divisons, all competetors, and interests for each competetor to assign themselves.

I was assigned multiple tasks during this development proccess. The first delegated task I completed was the mock ups for my team's HACC-hui websites. After creating the mock-up I then added the leave and delete team functionality as well as the list teams functionality. Both leave team and delete team would remove the developer from the collection and rightfully re-render the website to show that the function worked properly. List team allowed the user to see a list of all the teams and request to join a single team. I even added a filter function to allow teams to be filtered by keywords. We then merged into a single group being our entire class. During this development process I made the landing page mobile friendly as well as created the entire help page on the HACC-hui site. 

Here are pictures of the functionalities I helped complete...

I worked with Nathan, Kyle, and Wei Mai. The team chemistry was nice and everyone was helpful. We all helped each other at some point throughout the development proccess. My responsibilities were what was listed above, but we were all responsible for keeping each other on topic and making sure we all turned things in on time. We would have meetings before every presentation day to make sure everyone was up to speed. There were multiple github issues with commits and master getting messed up, but we all worked together and sorted everything out. 
Throughout this experience I learned that it takes an entire team to make HACC-hui come to life. It can't be done by one person because everyone's input is valid. There were multiple times where my teammates helped me understand how doing something a different way would make things easier/more efficient. I've always been someone who appreciates working alone, but this development procces taught me that working together is always helpful when trying to accomplish a big task.
