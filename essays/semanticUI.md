After using Semantic for the past few assignments, I have come to realize that libraries such as these allow for much faster production. Instead of styling everything through css, or hardcoding the HTML file, Semantic allows you to style through class specifications such as class="borderless inverted top menu". Without Semantic, there would be a much longer styling process to achieve a goal of creating someting as simple as a menu bar. Although the library names to call take some time to remember, the possibilities are worth the time you save from having to hard code it. If I continue to do WebDev, I will also continue to use Semantic UI. Im working on a fun, online interactive resume using Semantic, and I hope to finish it by the end of this semester.
