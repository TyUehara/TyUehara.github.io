After doing the 106 basic Javascript tutorials, I don't have any prefernece to the language yet. Although I do like how quick you can pull up an editor and test a program through Javascript. Javascript strikes me as a very simple and easy language to understand. Intitialization using var, let, and const, are also someting I need to practice using. I have a hard time deciding which intitialization type is best for certain situations. I have heard that people tend to stay away from Javascript because the security aspect of how the code executes on your computer can lead to exploitation. I am very excited to use Javascript this semester because I've always been interested in a scripting language, and I think this would be a great foundation for me. I am also excited to be using Javascript to software engineer. Software engineering has always been a term that would get thrown around by me, but I never had the opportunityy to step foot into it.

The WOD's are stressful for me, but it also forces me to fully understand the basics of Javascript without throwing priorities to the side. Being timed, and allowing myself to see concrete proof that I need to improve, or that I'm getting better is always something I appreciate.
