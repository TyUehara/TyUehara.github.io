When I was first introduced to coding style during ICS 111, I thought "why is coding style so important. I thought people just care if it outputs correctly." Now that I am in 314, and have seen coding style benefits. I can confirm that coding style doesn't only make code easier to read for others, but it allows you to structure code in your head before coding it. Organization isn't only important for yourself, but also for other comapnies you work for, and the clients you may programming for. Lastly, I realized that when teachers are strict with coding style, it is easier to learn from them. Their code is normallyy better structured, and therefore easier to comprehend. Coding style is important for every aspect of programming. It weighs the same importance as diction when speaking.
